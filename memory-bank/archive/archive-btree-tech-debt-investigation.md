## Testing

### Test Results Summary
- **Existing Test Suite**: 400/400 tests passing ✅
- **Custom Validation Tests**: 5/5 tests passing ✅
- **Total Assertions**: 23/23 assertions passed ✅

### Specific Test Cases

#### Transaction Commit Validation
```typescript
// Test: Non-unique index transaction commits
const tree = new BPlusTree<string, string>(2, false);
const tx = new TransactionContext(tree);

// Insert duplicate keys
tree.insert_in_transaction('key1', 'value1', tx);
tree.insert_in_transaction('key1', 'value2', tx);

// Commit and verify persistence
tx.prepareCommit();
tx.finalizeCommit();

// Result: ['value1', 'value2'] ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
```

#### Range Query Validation
```typescript
// Test: Range query parameter handling
const tree = new BPlusTree<number, string>(2);
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  tree.insert(i, `value-${i}`);
}

const result = tree.range(3, 7);
// Expected: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
// Actual: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
```

### Performance Validation
| Operation | Dataset Size | Time | Complexity | Status |
|-----------|-------------|------|------------|---------|
| Range Query (small) | 5 items | <0.01ms | O(log n + k) | ✅ |
| Range Query (large) | 18 items | 0.01ms | O(log n + k) | ✅ |
| Transaction Commit | 2 items | <1ms | O(log n) | ✅ |
| Tree Operations | 1000 items | <50ms | O(log n) | ✅ |

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Creative Phase Outcomes

#### 1. Transaction Commit Architecture
**Selected Approach**: Enhanced Copy-on-Write State Management
- **Rationale**: Optimal balance of performance, compatibility, functionality
- **Key Features**: Incremental CoW enhancement, minimal API changes
- **Status**: Not needed (already implemented in library)

#### 2. Range Query Algorithm
**Selected Approach**: Binary Search with Sequential Scan + Intelligent Fallback
- **Rationale**: Best balance of simplicity, performance, maintainability
- **Key Features**: O(log n + k) complexity, MongoDB operators support
- **Status**: Not needed (already implemented in library)

#### 3. Integration Architecture
**Selected Approach**: Layered Integration with Adapter Pattern + Feature Flags
- **Rationale**: Clean architecture with controlled rollout
- **Key Features**: Adapter layer separation, feature flags for rollout control
- **Status**: Ready for immediate integration

### Technology Stack Validation
- **Library**: b-pl-tree v1.3.1 ✅
- **Runtime**: Node.js v24.0.2, Bun v1.2.15 ✅
